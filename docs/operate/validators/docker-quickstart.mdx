# Production quickstart with docker and AWS on mainnet

## 1. Install CLI

Install the latest version of the `@hyperlane-xyz/cli` package with `npm install -g @hyperlane-xyz/cli`. Detailed CLI install instructions are available [here](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/reference/cli).

## Step 2: Setup validator keys on AWS KMS

### Create an IAM user

This IAM user will be given permission to sign with the KMS key that you will later configure. Your Hyperlane agent will use this identity when signing transactions.

1. Go to AWS's Identity and Access Management (IAM) in the [AWS console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home).
2. On the left, under "Access management", click "Users".
3. Click the blue button "Add users".
4. Pick a friendly and informative username, like `hyperlane-validator-${chain_name}` or `hyperlane-relayer-${chain_name}`. This username will be referenced in future steps, so if you choose a different username be sure to use your correct username in the future.
5. Click "Next", you do not need to assign the user any permissions.
6. Click "Create user".
7. Click into the user that you just created
8. Click the "Security Credentials" tab
9. Scroll down to "Access Keys" and click "Create Access Key"
10. Select "Application running outside AWS" and click "Next"
11. Click "Next", no need to add a description tag&#x20;
12. Click "Create access key"
13. Copy the "Access key ID" and "Secret access key" to a safe place. These will be passed to your Hyperlane Relayer as environment variables.

### Create a KMS key

This key will be used by your agent for signing.

1. Go to AWS's Key Management Service (KMS) in the AWS console.
2. Ensure you are in the region you want to create the key in. This can be confirmed by viewing the region at the top right of the console, or by finding the name in the URL's subdomain (e.g. `us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com` means you're operating in the region `us-west-2`).
3. On the left, click "Customer managed keys".
4. Click "Create key".
5. Select the "Asymmetric" key type.
6. Select the "Sign and verify" key usage.
7. Select the `ECC_SECG_P256K1` key spec.
8. Click "Next".
9. Set the Alias to something friendly and informative, like `hyperlane-validator-signer-${chain_name}` or `hyperlane-relayer-signer-${chain_name}`
10. While not necessary, feel free to write a description and add any tags that you think will be useful.
11. Click "Next".
12. A key administrator is not required, but if you want, you can select one.
13. Click "Next".
14. Give usage permissions to the IAM user you created in section #1.
15. Click "Next".
16. In the Review page, scroll to the "Key policy". The generated key policy is acceptable, but you can make the access even less permissive if you wish by:
    1. Removing the `kms:DescribeKey` and `kms:Verify` actions from the statement whose "Sid" is "Allow use of the key"
    2. Removing the entire statement whose "Sid" is "Allow attachment of persistent resources".
17. Click "Finish"

## 3. Register your operator

### Obtain your Hyperlane AVS signing address

We need to get the wallet address of the private key you created in step 2. You can use [Cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) or a script.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cast" label="With `cast`">

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<redacted> AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<redacted> AWS_KMS_KEY_ID=alias/your-key-alias cast wallet address --aws
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="script" label="Using a script">

The script at the following repo will allow you to query this address: [https://github.com/tkporter/get-aws-kms-address](https://github.com/tkporter/get-aws-kms-address)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

First, make sure you're registered with your operator key [as an EigenLayer operator](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/operator-guides/operator-installation#operator-configuration-and-registration) on Mainnet. You'll only need the ECDSA key.

Next, to register your operator to Hyperlane AVS, you can use the Hyperlane CLI. Register your operator key (generated via the EigenLayer CLI) by creating an ECDSA signature and submitting it along with the AVS signing key, which is your Hyperlane validator address from above (not a private key).

```bash
 hyperlane avs register --operatorKeyPath <PATH_TO_OPERATOR_KEY> \
    --chain ethereum \
    --avsSigningKeyAddress <AVS_SIGNING_ADDRESS>
```

Your AVS signing key can be reused across multiple validators and doesn't require additional registration for each. If you use different AVS signing keys for each validator, you'll need to register each as an operator.

## Setup 4: S3 bucket

Your Validator will post their signatures to this bucket.

1. Go to AWS's S3 in the AWS console.
2. On the right, click the orange "Create Bucket" button
3. Pick an informative bucket name, such as `hyperlane-validator-signatures-${validator_name}-${chain_name}`
4. Consider choosing the same region as the KMS key you created in the previous step.
5. Keep the recommended "ACLs disabled" setting for object ownership.
6. Configure public access settings so that the relayer can read your signatures
   1. Uncheck "Block all public access"
   2. Check the first two options that block access via access control lists
   3. Leave the last two options unchecked, we will be granting public read access via a bucket policy
   4. Acknowledge that these settings may result in public access to your bucket
7. The remaining default settings are fine, click the orange "Create bucket" button on the bottom

### Configure S3 bucket permissions

Your Validator IAM user will need write permissions, and it should be publicly readable by the Relayer.

1. Navigate back to "Identity and Access Management (IAM)" in the AWS console
2. Under "IAM resources" you should see at least one "User", click into that
3. Click on the name of the user that you provisioned earlier (e.g. `hyperlane-validator-${chain_name}`)
4. Copy the "User ARN" to your clipboard, it should look something like `arn:aws:iam::791444913613:user/hyperlane-validator-${chain_name}`
5. Navigate back to "S3" in the AWS console
6. Click on the name of the bucket you just created
7. Just under the name of the bucket, click "Permissions"
8. Scroll down to "Bucket policy" and click "Edit"
9. Enter the following contents. The Bucket ARN is shown just above where you enter the policy

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "${BUCKET_ARN}",
                "${BUCKET_ARN}/*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "${USER_ARN}"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "${BUCKET_ARN}/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Step: 5 Setup docker environment

### Create a directory for each chain you wish to validate

For example, create an ethereum directory and create config.json, docker-compose.yml, and .env
```bash
mkdir -p ethereum/hyperlane_db && \
touch ethereum/config.json ethereum/docker-compose.yml ethereum/.env
```

### Edit config.json

`customRpcUrls` are a comma separated list of performant RPC endpoints for the chain you wish to support, we recommend using paid providers to avoid rate limiting
`signer.region` and `validator.region` should be adjusted to your AWS region
`signer.id` and `validator.id` should be adjusted to your AWS KMS id you configured in step 3, prefixed with `alias/`
`originchainname` should reflect the chain 
`checkpointsyncer.bucket` should reflect the name of the S3 bucket
`checkpointsyncer.folder` is the name of the folder the validator will use within the bucket (you may use the same bucket for multiple validators, but ensure each folder name is unique per validator)
`reorgperiod` may be different for each chain [**find the reorgperiods**](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-registry/tree/main/chains)

```json
{
  "chains": {
    "ethereum": {
      "customRpcUrls": "https://eth.llamarpc.com,https://rpc.mevblocker.io",
      "signer": {
        "region": "us-east-1",
        "type": "aws",
        "id": "alias/hyperlane-validator-signer-ethereum"
      }
    }
  },
  "originchainname": "ethereum",
  "db": "/mnt/hyperlane_db",
  "validator": {
    "id": "alias/hyperlane-validator-signer-ethereum",
    "type": "aws",
    "region": "us-east-1"
  },
  "checkpointsyncer": {
    "bucket": "hyperlane-validator-signatures-ethereum",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "type": "s3",
    "folder": "ethereum"
  },
  "reorgperiod": 14,
  "metrics": "9090"
}
```

### Edit .env

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<Your AWS access key ID>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<Your AWS secret access key>
DB_PATH=./hyperlane_db # ./hyperlane_db
METRICS_PORT=9091 # Default is 9090, should match port set in config.json
CONFIG_FILE=./config.json # ./config.json
SERVICE_NAME=ethereum
```

### Edit docker-compose.yml

If you wish to run multiple validators, you could reuse the same docker-compose file but create different .env and config.json files per chain. 

```yaml
version: '3.8' 

services:
  validator:
    image: gcr.io/abacus-labs-dev/hyperlane-agent:f68319f-20240625-163648
    command: ./validator
    container_name: ${SERVICE_NAME-validator}
    ports:
      - "${METRICS_PORT}:9090/tcp"
    environment:
      CONFIG_FILES: /config.json
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
    configs:
      - config.json
    volumes:
      - ${DB_PATH}:/mnt/hyperlane_db
    restart: unless-stopped  # Ensure the container restarts unless explicitly stopped
    env_file:
      - .env

configs:
  config.json:
    file: ${CONFIG_FILE}
```

## Step 6. Run the Hyperlane validator 

Bring the container up 

```bash
cd ethereum && docker-compose up -d
```

Ensure there are no errors 

```bash
docker logs -f ethereum-validator
```
